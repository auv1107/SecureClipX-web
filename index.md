## FAQ
### How can data security be ensured?
After the user copies data, the app usually gets the clipboard data after 100 milliseconds. However, **SecureClipX** gets the data and protects it within the first 20 milliseconds.

### What are the three modes?
The three usage modes intercept data with different levels of intensity and methods.
Here is the translation preserving the formatting:

#### Interception Method
- Global Mode: Completely **takes over the system's copy and paste shortcut keys**, **any** copy record **will not** appear in the system clipboard.
- Manual Mode: Manually use **separate shortcut keys** for copying and pasting, **this part** of the copy record **will not** appear in the system clipboard, and is separated from the system clipboard.
- Whitelist Mode: Content that matches the whitelist is automatically removed from the system clipboard.

#### Interception Intensity
- Global Mode: Intercepts **all** data.
- Manual Mode: Intercepts **some** data. 
- Whitelist Mode: Intercepts **whitelisted** data.

### Which mode should I use?

Here is the translated content in American English, with the original markdown formatting preserved:

## When will it be open-sourced?

It will be open-sourced after the **Global Mode** development is completed. The **Manual Mode** and **Whitelist Mode** will be released successively after the open-source release.

Currently, all critical technologies have been **implemented**, and the **interaction design and integration** are **in progress**.

### If you have design üåà skills

UI is my weakness, welcome to discuss and contribute interaction design proposals.

### If you have development üßë‚Äçüíª skills

Feel free to submit PRs after the development repository is released.

### If you have substantial financial resources üí∞

You can [‚ù§Ô∏è sponsor the project](https://macaify.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/3e207e60-a329-48b9-86fc-e55e37d835d1?logo=0&discount=0) for future development.

I'm a full-time independent developer. I love coding and creating utility software. **SecureClipX** will be my first officially released open-source Mac software and the second free Mac software.

Currently, my income is entirely from the clipboard manager **CleanClip** below. I often post its updates on Reddit, and it has been well-received by many friends.

If you enjoy my work, you can support me by [üí∞ purchasing CleanClip](https://clip-purchase.macaify.com/) or [‚ù§Ô∏è sponsoring](https://macaify.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/3e207e60-a329-48b9-86fc-e55e37d835d1?logo=0&discount=0) the SecureClipX open-source project.
