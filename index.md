## Why Copi is needed

1. Defend against clipboard replacement attacks
2. Prevent clipboard content leaks

## Who needs it?

If you:
1. Own digital currencies
2. Often copy sensitive information
3. Don't trust the system clipboard

## How to use?

### 1. Action Bar mode
With the Action Bar enabled, when text is selected, quick buttons for secure copying and pasting will appear above the text. Click with the mouse to use the Copi clipboard for text operations. Long-press the text input field to show the paste option.

## FAQ

### How is data security ensured?

Copi uses the system's custom "service" function to get and paste text, instead of going through the system clipboard. Therefore, traditional attacks on the "system clipboard" will all be ineffective.

I'm a full-time independent developer. I love coding and creating utility software. **Copi** will be my first officially released open-source Mac software and the second free Mac software.

Currently, my income is entirely from the clipboard manager **CleanClip** below. I often post its updates on Reddit, and it has been well-received by many friends.

If you enjoy my work, you can support me by [üí∞ purchasing CleanClip](https://clip-purchase.macaify.com/) or [‚ù§Ô∏è sponsoring](https://macaify.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/3e207e60-a329-48b9-86fc-e55e37d835d1?logo=0&discount=0) the Copi open-source project.
